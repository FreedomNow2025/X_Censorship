# Censorship on X   (July 2025)

I think certain topics are being censored on X.  Elon Musk probably doesn't know. I hope this reaches him. I worry there are powerful groups who are able to get an employee or a few at X.

As a CTO/software engineer background, I debug. Here is my analysis. Test --> Results --> Proof?

I want people to focus on Incident #3 first.

* INCIDENT #1: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #1](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #2: [Notifications Change when in Censored Mode](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #3: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #2](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)

# Incident #3
## Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #2

THESIS:
1) I used to get 34 to 100 views on posts I made on my account. It got reduced to 3 to 7 views, when CENSORSHIP appeared to be TURNED ON.
2) When I reply to other posts, the censorship is not as bad.
3) I learned a lot from my Incident #1. This effectively repeated Incident #1's test, but I documented everything very well.
4) I did my post.  I then $500 Paid Promoted Post. Started July 24th 2025 and lasted 5 days.
5) I repeated what I did with my Incident #1's test. I had a chain of posts. Nearly all where 140 characters or less (so no overflow). This would help me catch the "top post censorship anomoly" (but that didn't happen in this case.

RESULTS:
a) I received only 51 views for my promoted post.  Grok and other searches said it should have been 75,000 views.
b) 51 views @ $500 = $10 USD each time a "view" happened. Someone saw it in their stream.  This appears to be censored.

THE TEST:
1) I paid $500 for this test, by doing a X Promoted Post. (Consumer, not formal ad network).  5 days x $100/day = $500.
2) x

 Stealing US tax dollars to have dictator control
* Funneling money to tech tools to enable DC dictator control
* Carrot/Stick forcing social media companies under DC hat Parlor was told they must use this or lose being in the Apple AppStore. Parlor capitulated (from my understanding)
