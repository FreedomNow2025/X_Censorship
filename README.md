# Censorship on X   (July 2025)

I think certain topics are being censored on X.  Elon Musk probably doesn't know. I hope this reaches him. I worry there are powerful groups who are able to get an employee or a few at X.

As a CTO/software engineer background, I debug. Here is my analysis. Test --> Results --> Proof?

I want people to focus on Incident #3 first.

* INCIDENT #1: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #1](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #2: [Notifications Change when in Censored Mode](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #3: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #2](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)

# Incident #3

US Censorship Industrial Complex: (Current or historic or side factors):

* [EU Government Organizations]()
* [Social Media firms](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/Social_Media_Companies.md) (Twitter v1.0, X.com, etc.)
* List of Efforts

* [Credit Card Companies](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/Credit_Cards.md)
* Tax Dollars paying to Censor US Citizens



Censorship via Whole-of-Society means:
* Democracy is removed. Citizens lose control. Dictator control by Wash DC bureaucrats.
* Free thought removed. MSM News turned into propoganda under control of DC dictators
* Stealing US tax dollars to have dictator control
* Funneling money to tech tools to enable DC dictator control
* Carrot/Stick forcing social media companies under DC dictator control. GAB threatened to be destroyed by EU laws.
* X.com worked on being killed by all advertising turned off (when Elon purchased it). DC Dictators had US intel control to get 99% of US Fortune 1000 companies to turn OFF their advertising IMMEDIATELY (all at one time).
 * Amazon and AWS. This is where servers run for Twitter / Gab and the others. This is another gun to the head of social media. Gab is the best illustration. They wouldn't roll out leftist censorship (which they were demanded to do).  Amazon AWS banned them from using servers. Parlor also on 1/10/2021.  Parlor was offline for weeks because AWS was pulled out from under them. Truth Social fled AWS servers Feb 2022.
* Censored by credit card companies. Gab lost Stripe credit card processing in 2018/2019.  Stripe turned OFF credit card processing for Parlor Jan-10-2021. Truth Social didn't use Stripe because they thought this problem would happen to them.
* PayPal for Credit Card processing by social media companies.  Gab lost paypal in October 2018. Gab in Jan 2021.
* Debanked. GAB CEO talked about being "banned by banks" in 2019. 
* Marc Andreesson on the Joe Rogan went into depth on how the gov "Operation Chock Point 2.0" politically targeted Republicans.  Startups (like social media companies) debanked because they were Republican. A gov operation with a code name. Scaling the number of people debanked (aka China Credit dictator punishments on USA soil)
* The political left had "Content moderation external services". These were censorship against Republican posts that were too annoying to democrats. At one point, I believe I heard an interview that Parlor was told they must use this or lose being in the Apple AppStore. Parlor capitulated (from my understanding). Their users had to endure this censorship (or whatever the impact was), but it was probably the only way for Parlor to stay in the Apple app store.

All were often coordinated to have punishments happen in the same month. Debanked. Credit card processing turned off. Advertising turned OFF. Apple & Android both were at risk of losing app store at the same time. This is because of the powerful elite with extreme power to coordinate dictator control forcing censorship.  Mass coordination. Getting a large percentage of USA Fortune 1,000 companies to turn off their advertising at the same time requires USA Intel service kinds off power and coordination.


Map these out:
* Freedom House
* Jigsaw
* 2022: DGB Dissolves in scandal.

* Newsguard: "moderation" (claims of censorship by Mike Benz)
* GlobSec: d
* NED:
* Perspective
* Bellingcat
* DFR Digital Sherlocks
* EuVsDisInfo
