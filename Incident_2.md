# Incident #2 Censorship on X   (July 2025)

I think certain topics are being censored on X.  Elon Musk probably doesn't know. I hope this reaches him. I worry there are powerful groups who are able to get an employee or a few at X.

As a CTO/software engineer background, I debug. Here is my analysis. Test --> Results --> Proof?

I want people to focus on Incident #3 first.

* INCIDENT #1: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #1](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #2: [Notifications Change when in Censored Mode](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)
* INCIDENT #3: [Possibly Censored Surpressed Paid Promoted Post #2](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/People.md)

# Incident #2
## When Censorship Turned ON, "Notifications" Changed Behavior

THE TEST:
1) There was a certain date that it appears (shadowban) Censorship turned ON.  The Notifications behaved different AFTER it was ON.
2) I mainly saw my Views-Per-Post go from 30 to 100 per post, to 3-to-8 per post with Censorship = ON.  There was a date cut off when that happened.
3) I saw something immediatley change on that date with Notifications.


CENSORSHIP RESULTS:
a) This happened exactly July 1st, 2025. You can only see the NIGHT and DAY difference by seeing the BEFORE vs AFTER screenshots below.
b) BEFORE: 100% of the time, when someone HEARTed my post or REPLIED, it appeared in Notifications.
c) AFTER: about 5% of the time, it appears.  For a while, 0% of the time.
d) It does post things it wants to push to me. Subscribe-only spaces. "new Pins" others do in groups I'm connected to.
e) This isn't censorship here. But is a factual thing I could document that linked 1-to-1 when my traffic was cut off (censorship).  This is meant to be debugging information if I could work with a software engineer in X.com to find the database properties that were switched.
f) The number of times people would interact with my post drop to very low also. As another aspect of this.

Catching the censoring person/group in X. The above can help find database values. This can track back to the code linked to this. What database values do they flag on accounts like me, when they shift it into Shadowban censorship mode.


DEEPER ANALYSIS:
a) See Incidents #1 and #3. The above is mainly a database debugging value that can be used to hunt down the DEV that changed database values when shifting my account into censorship mode.


Please email me if there is any help to uncensor my account on X.
