# Incident #4: Censorship on X   (Aug 2025)

I think certain topics are being censored on X.  Elon Musk probably doesn't know. I hope this reaches him. I worry there are powerful groups who are able to get an employee or a few at X.

As a CTO/software engineer background, I debug. Here is my analysis. Test --> Results --> Proof?

# Incident #4
## People REPLY to My Post. X Blocks me from Reading Replies

THE CENSORSHIP TEST:
1) When non-censored accounts on "X" have someone REPLY to their post, they can VIEW the replies.

CENSORSHIP RESULTS:
a) On my account, people REPLIED. But X blocks me from viewing their replies.

Please email me if there is any help to uncensor my account on X.
